# MNIST-classifier-from-scratch
MNIST classifier is developed using only numpy from scratch

### Introduction
In this project we classify the hand written digits to there numerical values. To accomplish the task neural network was developed from scratch by using the deep learning concepts.
### Data
The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.
### Results
accuracy in training is 93.75%.  
accuracy in testing is 93.54%.
